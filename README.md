# Simple Automatic Folder Backup - Python

This is a short Python script to automate the process of backing up folders to a specific destination on a scheduled basis. It copies the content of a source directory into a new folder within the destination directory labeled with the current date.

- Automatically copies a folder to the backup location
- Runs on a set schedule (Every Monday at 6:30 PM - To backup class preparation files)
- Prevents duplicated backups by checking if the backup already exists
- Simple and lightweight, using Python's built-in libraries
